# McDonalds-Case-Study
The dataset for the McDonald's case study contains information on various aspects of customer preferences and demographics, including ratings on attributes like tastiness, convenience, and healthiness, as well as demographic details such as age, gender, and visit frequency. The dataset requires cleaning, such as converting 'Like' ratings to integers and 'VisitFrequency' to a categorical variable, and handling missing values appropriately. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) will involve generating summary statistics, visualizing distributions, and identifying correlations between variables. Key findings may include the most liked attributes, demographic insights, and the frequency of visits. Based on the analysis, recommendations can be made for potential improvements or strategies for McDonald's, with suggestions for future work to further enhance insights.
