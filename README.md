# McDonalds-Case-Study
The dataset for the McDonald's case study contains information on various aspects of customer preferences and demographics, including ratings on attributes like tastiness, convenience, and healthiness, as well as demographic details such as age, gender, and visit frequency. The dataset requires cleaning, such as converting 'Like' ratings to integers and 'VisitFrequency' to a categorical variable, and handling missing values appropriately. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) will involve generating summary statistics, visualizing distributions, and identifying correlations between variables. Key findings may include the most liked attributes, demographic insights, and the frequency of visits. Based on the analysis, recommendations can be made for potential improvements or strategies for McDonald's, with suggestions for future work to further enhance insights.
Here i am going to perform first three steps, Data Loading: The dataset will be loaded from the provided CSV file into a DataFrame using the pd.read_csv() function. This step is important for accessing and working with the dataset in Python.

Data Cleaning and Preparation: After loading the dataset, data cleaning and preparation tasks will be performed. This may include handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting data types to ensure the dataset is ready for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Once the data is cleaned and prepared, exploratory data analysis (EDA) will be conducted. This involves exploring the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics. Summary statistics will be generated, distributions visualized, and patterns or trends identified in the data. EDA is essential for gaining insights and informing further analysis or modeling tasks.
